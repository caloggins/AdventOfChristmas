# AdventOfChristmas

[This little game](https://adventofcode.com/) was passed around at work. I figured I'd give it a try. The 2022 folder was just for experimentation. 2023 is the first year I've participated. Enjoy, or don't.

I decided to do this in JS for two reasons. Firstly, it's not been my primary language. Secondly, the unit testing is way smother during development. The big thing I wanted to do is solve these problems using test-driven development. I might do a few in C#, or (hopefully) Elixir.

## About the problems

Day 1 was okay, until part 2. The test criteria given for part 2 did not reflect the actual problem. That was annoying. I used the same code to solve both parts.

Day 2 was pretty basic. I was *really* tired, lol. Part 1 took a while to get through due to brain fog (damn you 99 Bananas). I'm sure it's way uglier than it needed to be. Part 2 was pretty simple. The 2 parts are done in separate folders.
